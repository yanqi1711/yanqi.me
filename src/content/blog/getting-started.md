This post outlines the essential steps to quickly set up your personal website using the [Astro AntfuStyle Theme](https://github.com/lin-stephanie/astro-antfustyle-theme). Each step may involve more detailed content, requiring you to consult other posts for further information.

## Preparation

(_Skip if you’re a developer_) To build your website with this theme, it's recommended to:

- [Install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager) for running and developing the project locally.
- [Install pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation) for managing dependencies.
- [Configure Git](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/getting-started-with-git/set-up-git) for version control.
- [Register on GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/start-your-journey/creating-an-account-on-github) for cloud hosting.
- [Install VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) for code editing. [Set up Git and sign in to GitHub](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/sourcecontrol/intro-to-git#_set-up-git-in-vs-code).
- Familiarity with [Astro](https://docs.astro.build/en/getting-started/) and [basic front-end knowledge](https://medium.com/swlh/web-development-fundamentals-for-newcomers-part-1-front-end-2e77f830754e) is a plus.

These are ideal conditions, but feel free to substitute with tools you're comfortable with.

## Create Your Project

Start with the latest theme version using one of two methods:

**Use GitHub**

Create a new repository in your GitHub account by clicking ["Use this template"](https://github.com/new?template_name=astro-antfustyle-theme&template_owner=lin-stephanie) (without commit history) or ["Fork"](https://github.com/lin-stephanie/astro-antfustyle-theme/fork) (preserves commit history) , then clone it locally:

```bash
# If SSH is not configured
git clone https://github.com/[YOUR_USERNAME]/[YOUR_REPO_NAME].git

# If SSH is configured
git clone git@github.com:[YOUR_USERNAME]/[YOUR_REPO_NAME].git
```

**Use CLI**

Run the following commands in your desired directory to start locally:

```bash
# npm 6.x
npm create astro@latest --template lin-stephanie/astro-antfustyle-theme

# npm 7+, extra double-dash is needed
npm create astro@latest -- --template lin-stephanie/astro-antfustyle-theme

# yarn
yarn create astro --template lin-stephanie/astro-antfustyle-theme

# pnpm
pnpm dlx create-astro --template lin-stephanie/astro-antfustyle-theme
```

> [!tip] 
> If you prefer not to use Git, you can [download the ZIP file](https://github.com/lin-stephanie/astro-antfustyle-theme/archive/refs/heads/main.zip), extract it, and work directly in your local directory.

## Launch the Project

Start the project by running the following commands from the project root (replace `pnpm` with your preferred package manager if needed):

```bash
# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Start the local dev server (opens at 'http://localhost:4321')
pnpm dev
```

You can explore the current theme freely. Additionally, the following commands are available:

> [!warning]- Handling Package Management Alternatives
> 
> This project uses `pnpm` as the package manager, so you’ll need to install it if you haven’t yet.
>
> You can execute `npm install -g pnpm` to [install `pnpm`](https://pnpm.io/installation) globally. Alternatively, you can [enable `corepack`](https://github.com/nodejs/corepack) (allows you to manage package manager versions directly via Node.js) or [install the `ni` tool](https://github.com/antfu-collective/ni) (simplifies running commands across different package managers).
>
> If you want to use a different package manager, make sure to [convert the project to your chosen package manager](https://astro-antfustyle-theme.vercel.app/blog/faqs-and-known-issues/#revert-from-pnpm-to-npm-or-yarn) before running its commands.

## Configure the Project

> [!important]
> Before configuring, it is advisable to review [**Project Structure**](https://astro-antfustyle-theme.vercel.app/blog/project-structure/) for an overview of the project and how it’s organized.

Configuration can be done in two steps:

- [**Basic Configuration**](https://astro-antfustyle-theme.vercel.app/blog/basic-configuration/): Customize the `src/config.ts` file.
- [**Advanced Configuration**](https://astro-antfustyle-theme.vercel.app/blog/advanced-configuration/): Customize the LOGOs, site icons, styles, fonts and footer.

## Authoring Content

Once configured, ensure the project is running correctly in your browser, then start creating or migrating your content. Jump to the section you're interested in:

- [**Add New Posts**](https://astro-antfustyle-theme.vercel.app/blog/add-new-posts/): For creating posts, writing tips, and guidelines.
- [**Recreate Current Pages**](https://astro-antfustyle-theme.vercel.app/blog/recreate-current-pages/): For recreating content for the `/`, `/projects`, `/changelog`, `/streams`, `/feeds`, and `404` pages, as well as deleting pages.
- [**Markdown Syntax Guide**](https://astro-antfustyle-theme.vercel.app/blog/markdown-syntax-guide/): Showcase the rendering of Markdown syntax in this theme.
- [**Markdown/MDX Extended Features**](https://astro-antfustyle-theme.vercel.app/blog/markdown-mdx-extended-features/): Extended syntax supported by the theme, including callouts (admonitions/alerts), fully-featured code blocks, image captions and links, video embeddings, styled GitHub links, and more.

## Deploy Your Project

Refer to [Astro’s Deployment Guide](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/deploy/) to choose your preferred platform and follow its guide. Ensure the `SITE.website` option in the `src/config.ts` is correctly set before deploying!

> [!tip]- Deploying Without a Git Repository Using CLI Tools
> If you aren’t using GitHub and any other Git provider for deployment, follow the [CLI Deployment Guide](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/deploy/#cli-deployment) to deploy without a Git repository, such as using [Vercel CLI](https://vercel.com/docs/deployments/deploy-with-vercel-cli#deploying-to-vercel-with-vercel-cli) or [Netlify CLI](https://docs.netlify.com/functions/deploy/#manual-deploys-with-cli).
