This post is about my foolish and selfish thoughts.

## OK, it's a game
If this world were a game, I would definitely play it again and again. 
There were too many things I wanted to do during my college years, but I did not have enough time and knowledge.

Something I want to change:
1. I would use GitHub well, I didn't leave any useful code before, so now I have no code to copy.
2. I would not spend too much money to buy a MacBook Air 2019(Intel Chip), I would buy a Lenovo Legion Y9000 and sell ​​it for the MacBook Air with an m1 chip. Because the MacBook Air 2019 has poor performance but is too expensive.
3. I would buy Tesla stock in my sophomore year and Nvdia stock in my senior yeas. There was undoubtedly correct.
4. Admitted to the 985 Institute. Spent all my college years completing it.

All of the above thoughts are because I want to change something now.
