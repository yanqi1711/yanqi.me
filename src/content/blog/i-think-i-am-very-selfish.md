This post is about my foolish and selfish thoughts.

## OK, it's a game
If this world were a game, I would definitely play it again and again.
There were too many things I wanted to do during my college years, but I did not have enough time and knowledge.

Something I want to change:
1. I would use GitHub well, I didn't leave any useful code before, so now I have no code to copy.
2. I would not spend too much money to buy a MacBook Air 2019(Intel Chip), it was a trash.
3. I would buy Tesla stock in my sophomore year and Nvdia stock in my senior year. There was undoubtedly correct investment :D
4. Admitted to the 985 Institute. Spent all my college years completing it.

All of the above thoughts are because I want to change something now.
