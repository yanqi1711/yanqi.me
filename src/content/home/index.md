Hello, I'm a embedded developer from China.

I am 24 years old. I were studying for [Postgraduate Entrance Examination](https://github.com/yanqi1711/pee).

From 2023-2024, I worked as an embedded developer in a smart driving service industry, using C, C++, Python, Shell, and other development languages, mainly dealing with operating system development, ROS software development, and unmanned driving camera driver development.

I also write some utility websites like [考研单词](https://words.yanqi.me/), some apps like [auto-clicker](https://github.com/yanqi1711/auto-clicker).

My future goal is to be an embedded full-stack developer in the real smart industry. If you are interested in hiring me, please contact me.
